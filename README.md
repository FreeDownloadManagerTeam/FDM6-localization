# FDM6-localization

Kindly help us improve Free Download Manager :)


This repository contains .po files for [FDM 6.x](http://www.freedownloadmanager.org/download.htm) localization. To edit files, you will need the [Poedit](https://poedit.net/download) program.


There are two ways to download the .po file for your language from GitHub.

1. Choose the file → click it → right click the Raw button ![raw](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FreeDownloadManagerTeam/FDM6-localization/master/readme1.png) → right click to save as…

The wanted file should be launched in the Poedit program. If it failed, try way 2.

2. Press the ‘Clone or download’ button → Download ZIP ![zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FreeDownloadManagerTeam/FDM6-localization/master/readme2.png)
